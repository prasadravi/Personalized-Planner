## 🚀 Overview

This project solves that by using AI-powered logic to generate **customized routines and meal plans** that are:

- 🏋️ Goal-based (fat loss, muscle gain, maintenance)  
- 🧘 Practical for your schedule and environment  
- 🍛 Respectful of cultural & dietary preferences  
- 💰 Budget-friendly and accessible  

The app dynamically builds a **7-day workout and meal plan**, color-codes rest/workout days,  
adds icons for each exercise, and lets you **download a professional PDF** summary.
